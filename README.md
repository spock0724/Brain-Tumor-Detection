# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Project: Tumor classification system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with Sklearn. It includes functionality to preprocess tumor image datasets, split data into training and testing sets, train KNN models for different tumor types (all types, pituitary, meningioma, glioma), evaluates model performance. Results visualized with confusion matrices.
