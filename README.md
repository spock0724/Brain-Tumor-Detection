# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Project: Tumor classification system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with Sklearn. It includes functionality to preprocess tumor image datasets, split data into training and testing sets, train KNN models for different tumor types (all types, pituitary, meningioma, glioma), evaluates model performance. Results visualized with confusion matrices.

## Data: 
   - The dataset used is provided in the 'brain_tumor_dataset.zip' compressed file, contains MRI scans of brains with and without tumors present.
## Dependencies:
- skimage: image I/O and processing
- scikit-learn: machine learning model training/evaluation.
- matplotlib: data visualization.
- pandas: data loading and manipulation.
- numpy: numerical computing, array operations.
- opencv (cv2): processing/computer vision.
- os: file handling and manipulation.
